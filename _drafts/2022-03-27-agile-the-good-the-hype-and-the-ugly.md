A review of "Agile!: The Good, the Hype and the Ugly"

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Good-Hype-Bertrand-Meyer/dp/3319051547](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Good-Hype-Bertrand-Meyer/dp/3319051547)

by Bertrand Meyer

Back in January 2001 I bought a copy of "Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change" by Kent Beck and drank the kool-aid.  Then I forced my team to drink the kool-aid too.  To be sympathetic to my younger self there weren't a lot of other drinks on offer at the time.  We had spent the 1990's watching IT projects fail and enjoying the write ups in the back pages of [Computing](https://www.computing.co.uk/).  So Kent Beck's book was a breath of fresh and it felt like it was presaging a new era.  It turns out it was, the Agile band wagon was about to roll a month after I bought the book, when 17 nerds met at the Snowbird ski resort in Utah.  The rest is history as they say.

The thing about history is a matter of interpretation but is written by the victors.  In this case Agile was been the victor.  However with the perspective of 20 years the costs of that victory are more apparent and some of our initial confidence has inevitably started to wain with age and experience.  Bertrand Meyer perhap presaging the swing away from some Agile practices 

Initially the title lead me expect (hope?) that Meyer would be mocking Agile.  Nothing in more satisfying the watching someone taking a pop at the prevaling dogma.  Indeed Meyer starts off in this vein pointing out that the seiminal image of Agile is a bunch of chubby programmers standing around a white board somewhere in the Snowbird ski resort.



the perspective of 2014 much of our behavious starts to look naieve.

Bertrand Meyer provides a Tour de Force in the French intellectual tradition with practical

Maintains a faintly mocking tone which make the book entertaining, but not cruel


Shame it is nearly Â£40 and not an epub.
